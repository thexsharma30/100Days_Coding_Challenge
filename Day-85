//Question: Recamans sequence
/*Given an integer n, return the first n elements of Recamanâ€™s sequence.
It is a function with domain and co-domain as whole numbers. It is recursively defined as below:
Specifically, let a(n) denote the (n+1)th term. (0 being the 1st term).
The rule says:
a(0) = 0
a(n) = a(n-1) - n, if a(n-1) - n > 0 and is not included in the sequence previously
       =  a(n-1) + n otherwise.*/

    static ArrayList<Integer> recamanSequence(int n){
        
        ArrayList<Integer> seq = new ArrayList<>();
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        
        
        seq.add(0);
        set.add(0);
        
        int i=1;
        
        while(i<n)
        {
            
            int ans  = seq.get(i-1)-i;
            
            if(ans <0 || set.contains(ans))
            {
                ans = seq.get(i-1)+i;
            }
            
            i++;
            seq.add(ans);
            set.add(ans);
        }
