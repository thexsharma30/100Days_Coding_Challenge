//Question : Count possible ways to construct buildings
//There is a road passing through a city with N plots on both sides of the road. Plots are arranged in a straight line on either side of the road. Determine the total number of ways to construct buildings in these 
//plots,ensuring that no two buildings are adjacent to each other. Specifically, buildings on opposite sides of the road cannot be adjacent

class Solution
{
    public int TotalWays(int N)
    {
        if(N == 1) return 4;
        if(N == 2) return 9;
        long a = 2 ;
        long b = 3;
        long m = 1000000007;
    long s = 0;
    for(int i = 3 ; i<=N;i++)
{
    s = (a + b) % m;
    a =b;
    b = s;
} 

        return (int)( (s * s)%m);
    }
}
