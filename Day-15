//Leetcode Question : Shortest path from 1 to n
//Consider a directed graph whose vertices are numbered from 1 to n. There is an edge from a vertex i to a vertex j if and only if either j = i + 1 or j = 3 * i. 
//The task is to find the minimum number of edges in a path from vertex 1 to vertex n.

class Solution{
    public int minStep(int n)
    {
        // code here
        int steps = 0;
        while(n > 1){
            if(n%3==0) n /= 3;
            else n--;
            steps++;
        }
        return steps;
    }
}
