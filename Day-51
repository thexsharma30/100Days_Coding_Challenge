/*Question: Techfest and the Queue
A Techfest is underway, and each participant is given a ticket with a unique number. Organizers decide to award prize points to everyone who has a ticket 
ID between a and b (inclusive). The points given to a participant with ticket number x will be the sum of powers of the prime factors of x.
For instance, if points are to be awarded to a participant with ticket number 12, the amount of points given out will be equal to the sum of powers in the prime factorization 
of 12 (22 Ã— 31), which will be 2 + 1 = 3. Given a and b, determine the sum of all the points that will be awarded to the participants with ticket numbers between a and b (inclusive).*/
