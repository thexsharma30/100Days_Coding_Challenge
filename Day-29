//Question : Painting the Fence
//Given a fence with n posts and k colors, find out the number of ways of painting the fence so that not more than two consecutive posts have the same colors.
//Since the answer can be large return it modulo 109 + 7.

    long countWays(int n,int k)
    {
        long mod = 1000000007;

        long diff = k;
        
        for(int i=2; i<=n; i++){
            long prev = same;
            same = diff;
            diff = (prev+same)*(k-1)%mod;
