//Question: Count all Possible Path
/*You are presented with an undirected connected graph consisting of n vertices and connections between them represented by an adjacency matrix. Your objective is to determine whether 
it is possible to start traversing from a node, x, and return to it after traversing all the vertices at least once, using each edge exactly once.*/

class Solution
{
    public int isPossible(int[][] paths)
    {
        int v = paths.length;
        int indeg[] = new int[v];
        
        for(int i=0;i<v;i++){
            for(int j=0;j<v;j++){
                if(paths[i][j]==1){
                    indeg[i]++;
                }
