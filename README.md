# 100 Days of Code Challenge

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code challenge repository! This repository is dedicated to tracking my progress as I embark on a journey to improve my coding skills over the next 100 days.

## Motivation

I've decided to take on this challenge to become a better programmer and to consistently work on my coding skills. By committing to code every day for the next 100 days, I aim to build a habit of consistent practice, learn new concepts, and work on projects that interest me.

## Rules

- Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.
- Encourage and support fellow participants.
- Share progress on social media using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode.

## Goals

- Learn a new programming language (Python, JavaScript, etc.).
- Complete a specific online course or tutorial series.
- Work on personal coding projects.
- Contribute to open source projects.
- Improve problem-solving skills through coding challenges and exercises.


## Resources

Here are some resources that I find helpful for my coding journey:

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)
