/*Question: Buy Maximum Stocks if i stocks can be bought on i-th day
In a stock market, there is a product with its infinite stocks. The stock prices are given for N days, where price[i] denotes the price of the stock on the ith day.
There is a rule that a customer can buy at most i stock on the ith day.
If the customer has an amount of k amount of money initially. The task is to find out the maximum number of stocks a customer can buy. */
