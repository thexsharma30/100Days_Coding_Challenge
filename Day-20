//Question - Minimize the Heights II
/*Given an array arr[] denoting heights of N towers and a positive integer K.

For each tower, you must perform exactly one of the following operations exactly once.

Increase the height of the tower by K
Decrease the height of the tower by K
Find out the minimum possible difference between the height of the shortest and tallest towers after you have modified each tower.

You can find a slight modification of the problem here.
Note: It is compulsory to increase or decrease the height by K for each tower. After the operation, the resultant array should not contain any negative integers.*/

    int getMinDiff(int[] arr, int n, int k) {
        // code here
        Arrays.sort(arr);
